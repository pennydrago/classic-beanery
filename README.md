# Codecademy project: Company home page (Classic Beanery)

## This is a website created with CSS Flexbox.

### Description
The aim of this [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) project was to create a company home page using CSS Flexbox.

This is a web page for a fictional coffee shop called Classic Beanery. Coffee was used for inspiration in selecting a color scheme. The monochromatic color scheme was based on shades and tints of the hue #AD8B73, a coffee color from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/).

Images were sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). A separate linked web page was created to credit the photographers for their images; this was an extension of the project.

The font and color contrast were chosen to increase accessibility. Website responsiveness was tested by resizing the browser window.
